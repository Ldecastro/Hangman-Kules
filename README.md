## Proverbial Hangman
A simple hangman game that runs in the command line.
Figure out a proverb by guessing
letters. If you guess a letter that's not in the
proverb and you've already guessed it, you get
a penalty.
The game ends when you guess all letters
correctly or when the hangman is finished.

It has almost 500 proverbs, in English and Hungarian.

To play, simply run hangman.py with Python 3.6

Tested on Linux only.

A simple GUI was made using PySide. To play, run hangman-pyside.py

At first start, a language selector window will pop up. Later it'll
be accessible by clicking on the small button with the globe icon.
